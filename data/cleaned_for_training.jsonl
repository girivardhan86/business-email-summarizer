This version was originally scheduled for limited testing, but due to an al misalignment, some users may receive incomplete feature sets unless they confirm their activation. We’ve observed minor inconsistencies in the rollout dashboard, and a handful of customers have reported delays, so it’s important you validate your access before the system rebalances overnight.
